	 C# and .NET Differences
	
	The main difference between these two is that C# is a programming language and the .NET Framework is a platform 
	in which languages such as C, C++, C#, and others can interoperate with one another. 

	The .NET Framework includes a large library and provides language interoperability 
	(each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages.
	Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (as contrasted to hardware environment), 
	known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as 
	security, memory management, and exception handling. The class library and the CLR together constitute 
	.NET Framework.
