	LIST OF IDEs
	------------ 


	1.Microsoft Visual Studio (IDE)

	Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. 
	It is used to develop console and graphical user interface applications along with Windows Forms 
	or WPF applications, web sites, web applications, web services, and also Windows Store apps 
	in both native code together with managed code for all platforms supported by Microsoft Windows, 
	Windows Mobile, Windows CE, .NET Framework, .NET Compact Framework and Microsoft Silverlight.

	Visual Studio supports different programming languages by means of language services, 
	which allow the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language,
	provided a language-specific service exists. Built-in languages include C/C++[5] (via Visual C++), VB.NET 
	(via Visual Basic .NET), C# (via Visual C#), and F# (as of Visual Studio 2010[6]). 
	Support for other languages such as M, Python, and Ruby among others is available via 
	language services installed separately. It also supports XML/XSLT, HTML/XHTML, JavaScript and CSS.

	2.NetBeans (IDE)

	NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing primarily with Java, 
	but also with other languages, in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5.[2] It is also an application platform 
	framework for Java desktop applications and others.
	The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms 
	supporting a compatible JVM.

	3.Eclipse (IDE)

	Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains a base workspace and an extensible 
	plug-in system for customizing the environment. Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop 
	applications. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other 
	programming languages: Ada, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Perl, PHP, Python, R, 
	Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. 
	It can also be used to develop packages for the software Mathematica. Development environments include 
	the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for 
	PHP, among others.

	4.MonoDevelop (IDE)

	MonoDevelop is an open source integrated development environment for Linux, OS X, and Windows. 
	Its primary focus is development of projects that use Mono and .NET frameworks. MonoDevelop integrates 
	features similar to those of NetBeans and Microsoft Visual Studio, such as automatic code completion, 
	source control, a graphical user interface (GUI) and Web designer. MonoDevelop integrates a Gtk# GUI 
	designer called Stetic.[6] It supports C#, F#, Java, Boo, Visual Basic.NET, Oxygene, CIL, Python, Vala, 
	C and C++.

	Developed by: Xamarin and the Mono community	
	Written in : C#, XML, and 14 others

	5.Xcode (Apple) (IDE)

	Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools 
	developed by Apple for developing software for OS X and iOS. First released in 2003, the latest stable 
	release is version 5.0 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for Mac OS X Lion and 
	OS X Mountain Lion users.

	Xcode supports C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java, AppleScript, Python, Ruby and Rez source code 
	with a variety of programming models, including but not limited to Cocoa, Carbon, and Java.

	6.KDevelop (IDE)

	KDevelop is a free software integrated development environment (IDE) for the KDE Platform on Unix-like 
	computer operating systems. KDevelop includes no compiler; instead, it uses an external compiler such 
	as GCC to produce executable code. The last stable release of the previous major version, 3.5.5, which
	is based on K Desktop Environment 3 technology, supports many programming languages such as Ada, Bash, 
	C, C++, Fortran, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. Released under the GNU General Public License, 
	KDevelop is free software.
